I am a machine learning researcher and engineer with over 5 years of experience implementing and training state-of-the-art machine learning models. My particular expertise is in the field of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), with an emphasis on computer vision. 

My research endeavors are driven by a commitment to enhancing the trustworthiness and interpretability of AI models. This focus is underpinned by my vision to facilitate the deployment of these models in real-world scenarios. By developing visually intuitive explanations of complex machine learning models, my goal is to make AI interpretable and trustworthy enough for use in practical applications.
